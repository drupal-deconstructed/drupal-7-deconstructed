# Drupal 7 Deconstructed

*How Drupal works: a plain(ish) English guide*

**Written by [Mike Crittenden](http://mikecr.it) with the help of [Rob Huffstedtler](https://github.com/rhuffstedtler) and the community.**

If you've ever wondered how Drupal works, then this book is for you.

It should be readable without having the actual core code in front of you, but feel free to reference the actual code for anything that you'd like as you go. I've tried to include API links to any functions or classes that I talk about, so click away!

  <dd>No. As long as you have a basic understanding of the basics of Drupal development, you should be fine.</dd>

  <dt>Why Drupal 7? What about Drupal 8?</dt>
  <dd>Drupal 7 because, at the time of this writing, Drupal 7 still has more than a year of shelf life. Drupal 8 Deconstructed will need to be written too, though!</dd>

  <dd>I'd like to dive into how some of the more popular contrib modules work, such as Views, Panels, CTools, etc., once the core chapters are complete.</dd>

  <dt>What about best practices for actually building Drupal sites?</dt>
  <dd>This book is specifically meant to be about how Drupal works, not about how to build and structure Drupal sites. For that, check out http://drupalorganised.com.</dd>
